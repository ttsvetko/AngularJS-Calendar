<h1><code ng:non-bindable=""></code>
<span class="hint"></span>
</h1>
<div><h2>Hello World!</h2>

<p>A great way for you to get started with AngularJS is to create the tradtional
"Hello World!" app:</p>

<ol>
<li>In your favorite text editor, create an HTML file
(for example, <code>helloworld.html</code>).</li>
<li>From the <strong>Source</strong> box below, copy and paste the code into your HTML file.
(Double-click on the source to easily select all.)</li>
<li>Open the file in your web browser.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Source</h2>
<div source-edit="" source-edit-deps="angular.js" source-edit-html="index.html-57" source-edit-css="" source-edit-js="" source-edit-unit="" source-edit-scenario=""></div>
<div class="tabbable"><div class="tab-pane" title="index.html">
<pre class="prettyprint linenums" ng-set-text="index.html-57" ng-html-wrap=" angular.js"></pre>
<script type="text/ng-template" id="index.html-57">
        Hello {{'World'}}!
    </script>
</div>
</div><h2>Demo</h2>
<div class="well doc-example-live" ng-embed-app="" ng-set-html="index.html-57" ng-eval-javascript=""></div>

<p>The resulting web page should look something like the following:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="img/helloworld.png" border="1"></p>

<p>Now let's take a closer look at that code, and see what is going on behind
the scenes.</p>

<p>The <code>ng-app</code> tags tells angular to process the entire HTML page and bootstrap the app when the page
is loaded:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
    &lt;html ng-app&gt;
</pre>

<p>The next line downloads the angular script:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
    &lt;script src="http://code.angularjs.org/angular-?.?.?.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>(For details on what happens when angular processes an HTML page,
see <a href="guide/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a>.)</p>

<p>Finally, this line in the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> of the page is the template that describes
how to display our greeting in the UI:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
    Hello {{'World'}}!
</pre>

<p>Note the use of the double curly brace markup (<code>{{ }}</code>) to bind the expression to
the greeting text. Here the expression is the string literal 'World'.</p>

<p>Next let's look at a more interesting example, that uses AngularJS to
bind a dynamic expression to our greeting text.</p>

<h2>Hello AngularJS World!</h2>

<p>This example demonstrates angular's two-way data binding:</p>

<ol>
<li>Edit the HTML file you created in the "Hello World!" example above.</li>
<li>Replace the contents of <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> with the code from the <strong>Source</strong> box below.</li>
<li>Refresh your browser window.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Source</h2>
<div source-edit="" source-edit-deps="angular.js" source-edit-html="index.html-58" source-edit-css="" source-edit-js="" source-edit-unit="" source-edit-scenario=""></div>
<div class="tabbable"><div class="tab-pane" title="index.html">
<pre class="prettyprint linenums" ng-set-text="index.html-58" ng-html-wrap=" angular.js"></pre>
<script type="text/ng-template" id="index.html-58">
  Your name: <input type="text" ng-model="yourname" placeholder="World">
  <hr>
  Hello {{yourname || 'World'}}!
 </script>
</div>
</div><h2>Demo</h2>
<div class="well doc-example-live" ng-embed-app="" ng-set-html="index.html-58" ng-eval-javascript=""></div>

<p>After the refresh, the page should look something like this:</p>

<p><img class="left" src="img/helloworld_2way.png" border="1" ></p>

<p>These are some of the important points to note from this example:</p>

<ul>
<li>The text input <a href="guide/directive">directive</a>
is bound to a model variable called <code>yourname</code>.</li>
<li><p>The double curly braces notation binds the <code>yourname</code> model to the greeting text.</p></li>
<li><p>You did not need to explicitly register an event listener or define an event handler for events!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now try typing your name into the input box, and notice the immediate change to
the displayed greeting. This demonstrates the concept of angular's
<a href="guide/dev_guide.templates.databinding">bi-directional data binding</a>. Any changes to the input
field are immediately
reflected in the model (one direction), and any changes to the model are
reflected in the greeting text (the other direction).</p>

<h2>Anatomy Of An Angular App</h2>

<p>This section describes the 3 parts of an angular app, and explains how they map to the
Model-View-Controller design pattern:</p>

<h3>Templates</h3>

<p>Templates, which you write in HTML and CSS, serve as the View. You add elements, attributes, and
markup to HTML, which serve as instructions to the angular compiler. The angular compiler is fully
extensible, meaning that with angular you can build your own declarative language on top of HTML!</p>

<h3>Application Logic and Behavior</h3>

<p>Application Logic and Behavior, which you define in JavaScript, serve as the Controller. With
angular (unlike with standard AJAX applications) you don't need to write additional listeners or
DOM manipulators, because they are built-in. This feature makes your application logic very easy to
write, test, maintain, and understand.</p>

<h3>Data</h3>

<p>The Model is referenced from properties on <a href="guide/scope">angular scope objects</a>.
The data in your model could be Javascript objects, arrays, or primitives, it doesn't matter.  What
matters is that these are all referenced by the scope object.</p>

<p>Angular employs scopes to keep your data model and your UI in sync.  Whenever something occurs to
change the state of the model, angular immediately reflects that change in the UI, and vice versa.</p>

<p>The following illustration shows the parts of an angular application and how they work together:</p>

<p><img class="left" src="img/angular_parts.png" border="0" /></p>

<p>In addition, angular comes with a set of Services, which have the following properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>The services provided are very useful for building web applications.</li>
<li>You can extend and add application-specific behavior to services.</li>
<li>Services include Dependency-Injection, XHR, caching, URL routing, and browser abstraction.</li>
</ul>
